            A Giant meteor is headed towards earth and the world will end in 1 Year. Our protagonist made a bucket
            list of things he/she wants to do before the world ends. The goal is to finish everything on the bucket
            list before the world ends.<br><br>

            I got a lot of practice for JavaScript, HTML and CSS from this project. I was also introduced to GitHub
            and Bootstrap during this project.

        <!-- Background Start -->
        <div class="card">
            <h5>Background</h5>
            In my "Game Design and Programming" class at school our teacher gave us an assignment. To make a Mini
            Text Adventure Game (MTAG). The original assignment requirements were... have a way to buy and sell
            items, have 10 items, and can't buy items if there's not have enough money... I think. As the teacher
            added more criteria, my team and I added more features.
        </div>
        <!-- Background End -->

        <!-- Concept Start -->
        <div class="card">
            <h5>Concept</h5>
            My teams original idea was, "to make a game were you play as a broke college student who's constantly
            in debt." Suddenly, we had to add a way to win for v 2.0 of our MTAG. I realized the player had no goal
            nor a way to win. Our old idea was most suitable for what most would call a sandbox. Somehow after
            brainstorming for about 3 minutes, I ended up with , "a person who's trying to do the things on his/her
            bucket list before the end of the world while in constant debt." It gave the player a goal, some
            checkpoints along the way to the goal, and most importantly a way to win. Since no one in the team came
            up with a better idea, it was given the OK.
        </div>
        <!-- Concept End -->

        <!-- Controls Start -->
        <div class="card">
            <h5>Controls</h5>
            My team wanted to make the game as simple as possible. Before the class started working on the MTAG's
            we were show last years MTAGs. The most common complain about them was probably "What do I do?" The UI
            was usually very confusing, the goal was unclear, and the controls were inconsistent. So my team and I
            decided to make our game so simple and straight forward. So straight forward, that we won't even have
            to teach the player how to play and also not leave them confused. One of my team members Jayden K gave
            the project a huge push by introducing Bootstrap, into the project and also making it look nice with
            CSS. After that I slowly made small adjustments to make the game look and feel better. At the same time
            I got much better at CSS and HTML which wasn't part of the curriculum of my specific class.
        </div>
        <!-- Controls End -->

        <!-- Big Features Start -->
        <div class="card">
            <h5>Big Features</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h6>Stack-able Inventory 11/2/2018</h6>
                    To meet the assignment requirements all I would have had to do was make a list of the items in the
                    inventory array. However that also means that if a player decides to buy 20 of the same item, then
                    inventory would display said item 20 times. The problem became even worst when we added the ability
                    to shop in bulk. In other words the player can buy 50 hot pockets in one visit to the store. So I
                    added item stacking. It uses 2 parallel arrays, one for an item index and another array for an
                    items quantity. Was a pain and struggle to add, but was completely worth it. Because of some dumb
                    error, this feature had problems with removing items until we were almost done with the game. It
                    somehow worked again when we added a new line somewhere.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>Random Events 11/05/2018</h6>
                    Each time the day changes, the player has a chance of suddenly having to pay bills, get jumped on
                    the way home, or even pick pocked. Was added to make the player more susceptible to suddenly go
                    into massive dept or other misfortunes. It made the game more spicy and unpredictable. It also gave
                    some of team members who were confused a chance to contribute by adding their own events.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>Job System 11/09/2018</h6>
                    The player can get a job to make money at the end of each week. However getting a job is not so
                    simple. Each job has a different chance of accepting the player when they apply, with scientist
                    being the lowest at a default of 3 percent. However the player can raise their chance of getting
                    into the career they want by taking internships. Internships are risky. They take a week to raise a
                    players employability 3 percent and only a for a specific job of the players choice. Also the
                    player cannot currently have a job to go in an internship. So when you take internships the player
                    loses time and money. Was another good opportunity to help out the other members something to do.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>Calendar 11/09/2018</h6>
                    To be completely honest, this feature was completely unnecessary. However, simply having the date
                    in the corner was too boring as well. So my team and I came to the somewhat logical conclusion of,
                    "Make a calendar in JavaScript and HTML from scratch. " Which was a lot easier said than done.
                    Obviously we searched online to try to find a preexisting calendar that we could embed into our
                    project first, but most of them came with too many files that we didn't know what to do with. The
                    biggest merit to the new calendar wasn't the calendar itself, but the fact that we literally had to
                    completely rip out our old time system (which was complete cancer btw) and make a completely new
                    one so that the calendar would even be possible. Unlike the old time system which would honestly
                    break itself all the time, the new time system is excellent and it's has never given us any errors
                    so far. It also paved the way for way better random events.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h6>Battle System 11/16/2018</h6>
                    It's basically a skimmed down version of the battle system from Pokemon. About 0.05 percent to be
                    exact. My team and I just wanted to use a damage formula, so we used to one from Pokemon. Each
                    character has a Level, Health, Attack, Defense, and Speed Stat. Also, each attack has a Name,
                    Attack Power and Accuracy. Which are all used in the battle system. This was probably the one
                    feature that gave me the most trouble. Only after completely rewriting half of it did started
                    working without any problems.

                    <img src="src/lifegraphs/graph1.png" width="100%" alt="">
                    The way players rated the shopping and selling slightly higher for version 2. The reason is
                    probably because we slightly raised the prices of some of the items and lowered their
                    effectiveness. Another reason is I got only got 7 survey responses for v2 and 23 responses for
                    v3.
                </div>
                <div class="col">

                    <img src="src/lifegraphs/graph2.png" width="100%" alt="">
                    More people said it was harder to get a job in version 3 which is certainly the case. I nerfed
                    the the effectiveness of internships and made them take 1 week in v3 instead of 1 day in v3.
                    Because of in error in my code the player was also susceptible to encountering multiple random
                    events during their internships.
                </div>

                    <img src="src/lifegraphs/graph1.png" width="100%" alt="">
                    The survey shows that people thought internships were less effective in v3. Again, I nerfed the
                    the effectiveness of internships and made them take 1 week in v3 instead of 1 day in v3. The
                    reason is that people were getting the top tier scientist job in the first week which was not
                    at all what was supposed to happen.

                    <img src="src/lifegraphs/graph2.png" width="100%" alt="">
                    The average player ended the game with a lot more money in v3 of the game. One reason could be
                    that a lot more people actually took the survey. Another reason could be that more people
                    played the game seriously, since v2 was still incomplete, and v3 was around 90% done.

                    <img src="src/lifegraphs/graph1.png" width="100%" alt="">
                    The games aesthetic was highly rated to begin with. The reason v3 was rated higher than v2 was
                    because that’s when we added the battle system and major improvements main hud. Another reason
                    is that I got more survey responses for v3 than v2.

                    <img src="src/lifegraphs/graph2.png" width="100%" alt="">
                    The game was very stable in v2 however because of a few rushed features in v3 I broke a couple
                    things including the battle system. As a result we received less good ratings for v3. Sucks
                    because I didn’t fix the problems until i got home.

                    Less people thought the game was confusion for v3. It’s not that surprising since it’s the same
                    group that played v2. And again there was more people doing the feedback survey.

                    More people they said they would willing to play the game again for v3. It’s not surprising
                    since the battle system was added in that update. Also well as item functionality, and an
                    ending.
