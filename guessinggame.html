            <h2>Guessing Game 10/26/18</h2>
            <h4>Guess a number 1 - 100</h4>
            The program generates 10 random numbers 1 - 100. If your guess is 5 away from any of the
            random
            numbers
            then you get 1 point, but if your guess is equal to a random number then you get 2 points.
            This project was an assignment for class. It was my first time using JavaScript in a
            practical
            way.
            Everything before this was mostly exercises to introduce us to new JS concepts and
            practice.

            Guessing Game 1.0 was the first practical program I made in class. When I first made it, it had a window prompt
            to collect user input, but it turns out Google Sites doesn't like pop ups. So "Guessing Game 1.1" you see above
            is not the original. When I first made it, I didn't know how to use loops, so I literally copied the same code
            10 times. It turns out I had the most sophisticated program in the class because no one else could read it,
            including the teacher. The funny thing is, it didn't meet ONE of the assignment criteria, so I didn't get full
            credit. One of the requirements was "too high or too feedback", but that's literally impossible for my game
            since there if multiple answers, or so I thought. The hardest part of making this program was getting the user
            input from the form input box to a variable. Up until then I had never really touched HTML so it was quite the
            challenge.

        <div class="card">
            <h5>How it works</h5>
            When you press the "Submit" button, a function called "GTN" runs.
            First GTN generates 10 random numbers 1 - 100 and puts them into an array called "rNumb"
            Then for each number in rNumb it calculates the difference between itself and whatever you might have entered
            into the input box and puts it into a new array called "minus".
            Then if the smallest number is in rNumb is less than 5 your score goes up by one. But, if the smallest number
            is equal to 0 your score goes up by two. In other words, if one of the random numbers is within 5 of your
            guess, you get 2 points, and if if it's equal to your guess you get 2 points.
            Update the text information.

        <!-- Feedback Start -->
        <div class="card">
            <h5>Feedback</h5>
            When I first completed the assignment the program only generated 3 random numbers. Despite the margin of error
            of 5, it would still take around 8 attempts to get even 1 point, let alone getting 2 from getting thecomplete
            same number. So I increased the amount of random numbers to 5. Which at the time meant, copying and pasting a
            chunk of code 2 more times. Then I was told that the game was still to hard, so naturally I pasted the same
            chunk 5 more times. In the end you win about 1 in 3 attempts.
