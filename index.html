            <p>
                I am a 17 year old programmer.<br><br>

                I am currently a senior in high school at Wayne Memorial.<br><br> I have been interested in programming
                since I was
                10 however only got into it seriously until I was 15. I'm currently taking a class in high school about
                programming which introduced me into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I've also been into CGI since
                the
                initial release of Blender 2.7 and I can make a fairly photo realistic render in Blender 2.8. People
                tell
                me my traditional art is pretty great. My favorite tradition art medium is watercolor.

                    <h4>Guess a number 1 - 100</h4>
                    <p>The program generates 10 random numbers 1 - 100. If your guess is 5 away from any of the
                        random
                        numbers
                        then you get 1 point, but if your guess is equal to a random number then you get 2 points.
                        This project was an assignment for class. It was my first time using JavaScript in a
                        practical
                        way.
                        Everything before this was mostly exercises to introduce us to new JS concepts and
                        practice.

                        list of things he/she wants to do before the world ends. The goal is to finish everything

                        the bucket

                    <p>I got a lot of practice for JavaScript, HTML and CSS from this project. I was also
                        introduced to
                        GitHub
                        and Bootstrap during this project.</p>
