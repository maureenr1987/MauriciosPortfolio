                <h5>Visual Studio</h5>
                <p>Was my first IDE. I mostly used it for C# in Unity and very limited C++ in Unreal Engine 4. I did
                    not spend enough time to get super familiar with it and its lack of an obvious debugging tool set
                    was a turn off for me.</p>

                <h5>VS Code</h5>
                <p>Is my main IDE for web development. HTML JavaScript and CSS. I originally used Visual Studio 2017
                    but everyone else in the class used VS Code so I switched. It's debugging features were very useful
                    for me since I had just started programming.

                <h5>Adobe Photoshop</h5>
                <p>I have been working with Photoshop since I was 14. I took a visual design class focused around on
                    Photoshop which helped me improve and learn some new techniques. Overall, I am proficient enough at
                    the program to get great results.

                <p>I found out about Illustrator through a visual design in high school. Up until then vector graphics
                    didn't exist for me. I'm only proficient enough at the program to make things that aren't too
                    detailed like logo's and emblems.

                <p>So far I mostly used it in the form of GitHub Desktop and the GitHub website. I use it for a group
                    projects to collaborate and to host all of my bigger projects because of the free domain.

                <p>I've been using blender since I was 13 and am a somewhat veteran at it. I'm still learning new
                    things about it every time I look. I can make fairly photo realistic renders with a bit of time.
