                If game feedback surveys have good categories and gaming criteria, then it makes it easier for
                developers to
                know where there are problems, and where they can make improvements.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col card">
                <h5>Difficulty</h5>
                Difficulty is usually one of the first things I ask for. Sometimes of a specific feature and
                other times of the entire game. I use the feedback to balance the games. So basically
                add/remove buff/nerf features.
            </div>
            <div class="col card">
                <h5>Effectiveness</h5>
                Asking for the effectiveness of features is important because if the player feels that a
                feature is redundant or is more trouble than it's worth, then they won't use it. And all of the
                trouble that was put into making it will be a waste.
            </div>

            <div class="col card">
                <h5>Stability</h5>
                If a feature only works 40 percent of the time then no one will use it, and if the game only
                works 60 percent of the time then no one will play it.
            </div>
            <div class="col card">
                <h5>Graphics/Aesthetic
                </h5>
                If my eyes hurt after playing a game I'm not going to play it again. Also, it's hard to attract
                new players if they don't want to play your game just by the screenshots.
            </div>
            <div class="col card">
                <h5>Confusion</h5>
                If the player doesn't know what to do then that's just tragic. Good feedback to know if
                something should be simplified or removed.
            </div>
            <div class="col card">

                after its first completion.

                <h5>Problem Solving</h5>
                When I finished Guessing Game 1.0 it was a game where the player had to guess from 10 randomly
                generated numbers 1-100 with a margin of error of 5. Later, the teacher wanted everyone to add "Too
                High/Too Low" feedback to their guessing games. Since my game had multiple answers, it was a lot
                harder
                to give the "Too High/Too Low" feedback. Eventually I found a way to make it work without starting
                over. It was to sort the generated answers into 3 categories, too high, too low and correct.<br><br>

                When my team and I were working on our MTAG, we eventually we came to the realization that our time
                system was garbage. Previously, my team had discussed the possibility of adding a calendar. Now
                seemed
                like a better time than ever to make that happen. Unfortunately that was easier said than done. At
                first I searched online to see if anyone had made anything that I could look at for reference, but
                I
                didn't find anything.<br><br>

                So I just sat down and thought about what is the best way to make a simple calendar that displays
                weekday, day, month, and year. It also has to update itself using only a number 1 - 365 so that it
                would be easy to increment the date, not break easily, and preferable can be made without using
                external assets. Long story- short, I did eventually figure something out. Unfortunately, I forgot
                how
                it works, so now my team treats it like some scary monster in the corner that we have no choice but
                to
                trust. We know it works, but no one knows how.
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h5>Teamwork</h5>
                When I was working on my MTAG (Life - The Game) I was part of the largest team in the class with a
                grand total of 6. Since it was our first time doing collaboration for most of the team, we
                struggled to
                finding something for everyone to do. In the end, our team settled with 2 programmers that focus on
                adding new features, one debugger that we call for help when the project spontaneously explodes,
                and 2
                programmers that focus on adding content once the features work, and one games tester that that
                takes
                notes for balancing the game.<br><br>

                I was one of the new feature programmers. Usually after I would add a new feature I would go and
                explain it to the content programmers so they could add more content into the game. I would also
                add
                tons of comments in the code so that even if they forgot what I said they could figure it out
                anyways.
                <br><br>

                Since some of the other team members were less proficient at JavaScript, I would usually help them
                out
                so that they can still contribute to the project in a meaningful way. At the same time the team was
                working on the MTAG, we were still receiving assignments from the teacher. Usually we would take
                turns
                doing the assignments, but if team work was allowed, then I would do it.
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h5>Creativity</h5>
                For my Game Design and Programming class my team and I had one of the more unusual story concepts
                for
                our Mini Text Adventure Game. It was, "a person who's trying to do the things on his/her bucket
                list
                before the end of the world while in constant debt." It was a scenario I came up with, and it met
                all
                of the assignment criteria and while also remaining very open ended for more creative freedom.<br><br>

                At some point in the Life - The Games's development, we needed to add profile pictures into the
                game so
                the player wouldn't get confused. For some reason one of the team members decided to use a picture
                of
                sponge bob as the default player profile pic. All the other team members didn't question it and
                followed suite. So now everyone in the game is a sponge bob character.<br><br>

                We also added random events and random encounters into the game to make it more spicy. This ended
                up
                becoming one our games strong points as the player could go into massive debt or win the jackpot in
                a
                very short amount of time.
